## Understanding the gaps that exist between potential clothes donors and charitable organizations

In this study, we analyse the gap that exists between the potential donors and charitable organizations while donating clothes to
these organizations. We deploy descriptive online surveys and in-depth qualitative interviews to explore how people perceive,
acquire knowledge, and form attitudes and practices concerning these clothing donations. Our research indicated three core
themes: (1) Little awareness about these charitable organizations; (2) Lack of communication between the potential donors and
organizations; and (3) absence of trust in the donors. We reflect on these findings and develop a mobile application that facilitates
the entire procedure of donating clothes to the relevant entities. After designing and prototyping the application, usability testing
was conducted with the target audiences to ensure that the application is attractive to the user, easy to operate, and specific to our
target groups.


Clothing donations are widely made throughout the nation as a ritual. In addition to the motivation of fulfilling human
rights, there is also a religious motive that makes people in Pakistan donate clothes extensively. Most of the people
prefer giving away to their help house or needy people nearby because of the lack of awareness, trust and
inconvenience in the process of donating to charitable organizations. For this reason, a large chunk of less privileged
people who do not have proximity to wealthy people are not able to benefit from this redistribution process. 
KapraEid aspired to fulfil these gaps by bringing the charitable organizations and donors on the same platform and
making the donation process convenient and transparent.
While we have tried to bridge the gap between our target groups by increasing communication, enabling
convenience, raising awareness, and making the application easy to use, other problems could also be addressed
through the application. Conducting the interviews emphasized the gaps in the donation process that remain
untapped. Tracking of the donations can be introduced to make the procedure more transparent. Additionally, there
are several other features that can help the organizations in collecting and sorting the donations. Organizations can
be facilitated to forward the donations to the riders like food delivery applications do. More importantly, sizes and
types of clothing can be separated by collecting the relevant data from the donors that would free the organizations
from sorting them manually. We aim to explore more about these ideas by conducting another research and then
incorporate the results in the final product to increase the user experience and usability of the application
